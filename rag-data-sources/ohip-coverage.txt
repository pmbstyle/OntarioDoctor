Doctors
Whether you visit your doctor, or if you see one in a walk-in clinic, OHIP covers the full cost of your services – as long as they’re medically necessary. This includes both medically necessary in-person visits, as well as medically necessary virtual visits delivered by video or telephone.

Hospital visits and stays
If you need to go to the hospital, OHIP covers:

- doctor and nursing services
- services to diagnose what’s wrong (such as blood tests and x-rays)
- medications for in-patients (once a patient is discharged, prescribed medications are not covered)
- medications administered to out-patients when a hospital visit is required in order to administer the medications
- certain medications that are provided to out-patients for home use
- accommodation and meals if you have to stay
- if you want a private or semi-private room, you or your private insurance will have to pay some or all of those hospital fees

Laboratory testing
OHIP covers lab tests taken in hospitals that are medically necessary.

Hospital patients should have their tests taken at the hospital to avoid any possible out-of-pocket charges.

OHIP also covers medically necessary lab tests taken in non-hospital settings, such as community labs.

Non-hospital patients should have their test done in a community lab if they have a lab order from a clinical provider such as a licensed physician, midwife or nurse practitioner.

Before you have your laboratory testing done, speak to your health care provider about:

What is not covered by OHIP
OHIP does not cover some specialized, non-routine tests. For other tests, OHIP will only cover them if you meet certain eligibility criteria and a particular health care provider (physician, midwife, nurse practitioner) ordered the test. A few examples of tests that are not covered by OHIP except under specific circumstances include:

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is covered by OHIP if either of the following apply to you:

you have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and are receiving treatment or following up after receiving treatment for the disease
a healthcare provider (for example, physician) suspects prostate cancer because of your history and/or the results of your physical examination (including digital rectal examination)
For all other scenarios, you will need to pay for PSA.

Aspartate aminotransferase test (AST) is covered by OHIP if ordered by a physician who specializes in liver diseases.

For all other scenarios, you will need to pay for AST.

25-hydroxy vitamin D test is covered by OHIP if you have any of the following conditions:

- osteoporosis
- rickets
- osteopenia
- malabsorption syndromes
- renal disease
- drugs that affect vitamin D metabolism
For all other scenarios, you will need to pay for a vitamin D test.

Abortion services
OHIP covers the cost of:

- surgical abortions that take place in a hospital or clinic
- Mifegymiso (a pill that induces an abortion in early pregnancy), if you have a prescription from your doctor

Dental surgery in hospital
Some dental surgeries need to be performed in a hospital because they are complex and/or you have another medical condition that needs monitoring during the procedure.

OHIP covers in-hospital dental surgeries such as:

- fracture repair

- medically necessary tooth removal (prior approval by OHIP is required)

Podiatry (foot-health services)
OHIP covers between $7-16 of each visit to a registered podiatrist up to $135 per patient per year, plus $30 for x-rays. You will need to pay for the remainder of the cost of each visit.

Surgeries performed by podiatrists are not covered by OHIP.

Protecting your access to Ontario’s Public Health Care services
Through the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004 (CFMA), the province of Ontario upholds the Canada Health Act's requirement for provinces and territories to prohibit extra-billing and user charges for OHIP insured health care services.

In Ontario, it is prohibited for a person or entity to:

- charge OHIP-insured persons for an insured service or a component of an insured service
- pay or receive a fee or benefit from an insured person for providing preferred access to an insured service
- require an insured person to pay a block fee in order for that person to receive an insured service (a block fee is a charge that covers a group of uninsured services over a specific period of time)
If you’re charged for an insured service
- If you believe that you may have been charged for an insured service or for access to an insured service:

e-mail us the details, including the name of the person or entity and the insured service
call us at 1-888-662-6613
If the ministry finds that a person has paid for an insured service or part of an insured service, the ministry will make sure the full amount of the unauthorized payment is returned to that person.

Protect your health card number
Only share your health card number with health care professionals who are entitled to have it, such as:

- doctors
- nurse practitioners
- hospitals
- chiropractors
- optometrists
You can use your health card as a form of identification for other reasons, but no one else can record or copy your health card number. If your health card number falls into the wrong hands, it could be used to access to your personal health information or for OHIP fraud.
