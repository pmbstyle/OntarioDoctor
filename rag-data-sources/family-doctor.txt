Find a family doctor or nurse practitioner
A family doctor or nurse practitioner is your primary health care clinician – meaning they are the person you make an appointment with when you have a new, non-emergency health concern. You can learn more about their services below.

Here are two options to find a family doctor or nurse practitioner who is accepting new patients:

1.Register with Health Care Connect and have a nurse find a doctor or nurse practitioner for you.
2.Contact an Ontario physician to ask if they are accepting new patients.
- Use The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario’s Find a Doctor search.
- Choose “Advanced Search” to find a doctor near you (by city/town or postal code).
- Click on “Additional Search Options” to narrow your search (to family doctors and/or language spoken).
- Contact the doctor to check if they are accepting new patients.
